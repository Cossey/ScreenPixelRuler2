# Background
I was using *MioPlanet PixelRuler* for pixel precise measuring of user interface spacing and found that it was lacking some quality of life features. 
The utility is quite dated and I needed the ability to freeze the ruler measurements, shift the start of the ruler to the current cursor position and flip the hatch markings.

I decided that I should write my own one based on the .NET framework and open-source it.
The [first version](https://github.com/Cossey/screenpixelruler) was written in Visual Basic.Net and based on the .NET Framework 4.5.
This new version is rewritten from the ground up in C# and based on .NET Core 3.1.
