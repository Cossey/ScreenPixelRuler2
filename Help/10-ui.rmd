# User Interface {#ui}

The user interface consists of a single ruler that can be displayed either horizontally or vertically.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="The Ruler user interface."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ruler.png")
```

Pressing the secondary mouse button on the ruler will display a context menu called the *Ruler Menu*.
The secondary button is usually the right mouse button.

The ruler can be rotated using the `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + R` key combination or by the *Rotate* menu item in the *Ruler Menu*.

> It is not possible to have both a vertical and a horizontal ruler displayed at the same time.
