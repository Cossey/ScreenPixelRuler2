#### UI Theme Elements

This section helps explains the user interface theme elements.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The Ruler user interface with theme elements highlighted."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ruler-theme.png")
```

Zero is the Zero Mark which is explained further below.

Numbers are configured in `Ruler → Number` secion.
The `Ruler → Number → Display → Interval` determines how often the numbers appear.
An interval of `50` means that numbers will appear at the 50th, 100th, 150th, etc hatch marks.
The other properties under `Ruler → Number` determine the font, colour and size of the numbers.

Cursor is explained further below.

Background is the background colour of the ruler.
This is set at `Ruler → Background` and can be a single colour or a gradient when two colours are provided.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The cursor that appears in the ruler."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ruler-cursor.png")
```

The cursor is displayed at the position of the mouse cursor on screen, relative to the ruler.
If the cursor is to the far top or far left to the ruler, the it does not appear.

The above options are all configured in the `Cursor` section.
`Cursor → Frozen` is used when the cursor is [frozen](\#freezing-the-cursor).
`Cursor → Locked` is used when the cursor is [locked to a guideline](\#locking-to-guidelines).

*Offset* `Ruler → Cursor → Offset` is used to add additional padding between the cursor number and the cursor background square.
The padding is added to the top of the number unless the number is rotated, if rotated then it is added to the right side.

*Cursor Background* `Cursor → Background` is used to set the background colour of the cursor square.

*Cursor Line* `Cursor → Line` is used to set the colour of the line of the cursor.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The ruler hatch marks."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ruler-hashmarks.png")
```

*Zero Mark* hatch mark is provided by the `Ruler → Marks → Zero → Size` property.
You can also set the `Ruler → Marks → Zero → NumberVisible` property to `false` to omit the 0 number.

Size interval 10 and Size Interval 50 hatch marks are provided by the `Ruler → Marks → Sizes` array.
Below is an example of a 50 pixel interval hatch mark:

```yaml
...
  Marks:
    Sizes:
      - Interval: 50
        Colour: #000000
        Size:
          Horizontal: 20
          Vertical: 40
...
```

*Marks Size* hatch marks are provided by the `Ruler → Marks → Size` properties.
The colour is provided by the `Ruler → Marks → Colour` property.
Every even pixel on the ruler will have a hatch mark provided by this value.
Set the size to `0` to omit the default hatch marks.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Vertical ruler."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ruler-vertical.png")
```
*Padding* from the `Ruler → Numbers → Padding` property, applies padding to the numbers from the nearest edge.

*Opposite Offset Padding* under the `Ruler → Numbers → OppositeOffsetPadding`) property is the additional padding that is applied when the ruler is flipped to the opposite default direction.
This is applied in addition to any padding that is applied via `Ruler → Numbers → Padding` property.

*Vertical Rotate* (the `Ruler → Numbers → Display → Vertical → Rotate` and `Ruler → Numbers → Display → Horizontal → Rotate` properties) rotates the numbers 90 degrees.

> Note: The direction of the rotated numbers cannot be changed.
