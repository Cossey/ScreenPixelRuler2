Figure 1: The ruler user interface. Holding down the primary mouse button on the ruler will allow you to drag the ruler around the screen. Pressing the secondary mouse button on the ruler will display a context menu called the Ruler Menu. If the mouse cursor moves past the right or bottom edge of the ruler, it will automatically extend. The ruler will stay extended if the cursor is frozen or if a Guideline has been set beyond the default size. Guidelines are covered in further detail in the Guidelines section. The primary mouse button is determined by the Select your primary button option in the Mouse Settings in Microsoft Windows. Normally, it is the left mouse button. Rotating the ruler The ruler can be rotated using the Ctrl + Shift + Alt + R key combination or by the Ruler Menu → Rotate menu item. This is assignable to a mouse button click via the Rotate function. It is not possible to have both a vertical and a horizontal ruler displayed at the same time. When rotating the ruler, the axis changes but any Guidelines are kept in the same position. Flipping the ruler Figure 2: The horizontal ruler flipped in both directions. The hatch marks on the ruler can be flipped to be displayed on the opposite side of the ruler. This is done by pressing the Ctrl + Shift + Alt + E key combination or by the Ruler Menu → Flip Direction menu item. This is assignable to a mouse button click via the Flip function. Freezing the Cursor You can freeze the cursor on the ruler so that it does not move with the mouse. This is done by pressing the Ctrl + Shift + Alt + F key combination. Exiting the software Exit the software by pressing the Ctrl + Shift + Alt + X key combination or via the Ruler Menu → Exit menu item.
